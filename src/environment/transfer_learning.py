transfer_learning.py

Utilities for transfer learning and domain adaptation in neuro-fuzzy multiagent systems.

Includes:
- FeatureExtractor: Simple feature extraction stub (extensible to neural/statistical models).
- domain_adaptation: Placeholder for aligning source/target features.
- transfer_learning: Workflow for pretraining and finetuning models across environments.

These utilities support experiments in transfer learning, domain adaptation, and feature learning across diverse environments.
