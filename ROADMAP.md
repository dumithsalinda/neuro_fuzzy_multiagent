# Neuro-Fuzzy Multi-Agent System Roadmap

## Grand Vision

**Build an Environment-Independent Dynamic Self-Organizing Neuro-Fuzzy Multi-Agent System**

---

## Phase 1: Environment Independence & Abstraction

- **Unified Environment API**
  - Design and implement a base `Environment` interface for all environments (simulated, real-world, hybrid).
  - Ensure all environment types inherit from this interface for plug-and-play compatibility.
- **Dynamic Environment Switching**
  - Implement an environment factory/registry to enable runtime switching and discovery.
- **State/Observation Converters**
  - Create converters for translating raw environment states into agent-agnostic feature spaces.
  - Support normalization, encoding, and sensor fusion as needed.
- **Environment Validation Suite**
  - Develop tests and validation tools to ensure new environments adhere to the unified API.

**Optional Enhancements:**

- Add wrappers for popular RL benchmarks (OpenAI Gym, etc.).
- Support for asynchronous/multi-threaded environments.

---

## Phase 2: Dynamic Self-Organization

- **Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) & Feature Clustering**
  - Integrate SOMs or similar algorithms for unsupervised feature clustering.
  - Enable agents to discover latent structure in observations.
- **Agent Group Formation & Dissolution**
  - Implement mechanisms for agents to dynamically form, join, or leave groups based on similarity, task, or environment.
- **Dynamic Module Creation/Removal**
  - Allow creation/removal of agent modules (rules, subnetworks, behaviors) at runtime.
- **Dashboard Visualization**
  - Visualize agent clusters/groups, SOM mappings, and group dynamics in the dashboard.
- **Group-Level Policies**
  - Support for group-level decision-making and knowledge sharing.

**Optional Enhancements:**

- Add inter-group negotiation/competition.
- Group-based reward shaping.

---

## Phase 3: Advanced Neuro-Fuzzy Hybridization

- **ANFIS & Hybrid Model Integration**
  - Implement and benchmark Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) and improved hybrid architectures.
  - Support modular plug-in of new hybrid models.
- **Self-Tuning Fuzzy Membership Functions**
  - Enable agents to adapt membership function parameters (centers, widths, types) online.
  - Support multiple membership function types (Gaussian, triangular, trapezoidal, etc.).
- **Dynamic Fuzzy Rule Generation/Pruning**
  - Implement data-driven rule creation and pruning based on usage, error, or novelty.
  - Visualize rule evolution over time.
- **Dashboard Controls for Fuzzy Rules**
  - Add UI for inspecting, editing, adding, and removing fuzzy rules and membership parameters.
  - Visualize rule firing strengths and statistics.
- **Explainable Hybrid Decisions**
  - Provide explanations for agent decisions, showing rule activations and neural/fuzzy contributions.

**Optional Enhancements:**

- Support for hierarchical fuzzy systems.
- Automated fuzzy rule extraction from data.

---

## Phase 4: Online/Continual Learning

- **Incremental/Online Agent Updates**
  - Refactor agents for online learning (stochastic updates, streaming data).
- **Experience Replay & Memory Management**
  - Integrate experience replay buffers for continual learning and stability.
  - Support prioritized and episodic replay.
- **Meta-Learning Hooks**
  - Add hooks for adaptive learning rates, meta-parameters, and learning-to-learn strategies.
- **Dashboard Toggles & Monitoring**
  - UI controls to toggle online/continual learning.
  - Visualize learning curves, memory usage, and adaptation over time.

**Optional Enhancements:**

- Lifelong learning with knowledge consolidation.
- Catastrophic forgetting mitigation techniques.

---

## Phase 5: Explainability & Visualization

- **Rule & Attention Visualization**
  - Visualize fuzzy rules, neural attention weights, and decision pathways.
- **Group Structure & Dynamics**
  - Real-time visualization of agent groups, roles, and interactions.
- **Action & State Tracebacks**
  - Enable users to trace agent actions back to rules, inputs, and group context.
- **Interactive Scenario Playback**
  - Replay and inspect past episodes with detailed annotations.

**Optional Enhancements:**

- Natural language explanations for agent/group behavior.
- Human-in-the-loop debugging and feedback tools.

---

## Phase 6: Advanced Extensions & Real-World Integration

- **Multi-Modal Perception**
  - Integrate agents with vision, audio, text, and sensor modalities.
  - Support multi-modal fusion at the neuro-fuzzy level.
- **Distributed & Scalable Agents**
  - Deploy agents across distributed systems or cloud infrastructure.
- **Human-Agent Collaboration**
  - Add natural language interfaces for control, teaching, and feedback.
- **Robustness & Safety**
  - Implement robustness to noise, partial observability, and adversarial conditions.
  - Add safety constraints and monitoring.

**Optional Enhancements:**

- Real-world robotics integration.
- Benchmarking against state-of-the-art multi-agent and neuro-fuzzy systems.

- Implement richer inter-agent communication protocols
- Analyze/visualize emergent comms
- Add cloud dashboard, user auth, collaborative experiments
