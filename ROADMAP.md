# Neuro-Fuzzy Multi-Agent System Roadmap

## Grand Vision

**Build an Environment-Independent Dynamic Self-Organizing Neuro-Fuzzy Multi-Agent System**

---

## Phase 1: Environment Independence & Abstraction

- Define a unified `Environment` interface for all environments (sim, real-world, etc.)
- Refactor environments to inherit from this interface
- Implement dynamic environment switching (factory/registry)
- Add state/observation converters for agent-agnostic input

## Phase 2: Dynamic Self-Organization

- Integrate Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) or similar for feature clustering
- Implement agent group formation/dissolution
- Enable dynamic module creation/removal (rules, subnetworks)
- Visualize agent clusters/groups in dashboard

## Phase 3: Advanced Neuro-Fuzzy Hybridization

- Implement ANFIS or improved hybrid models
- Add self-tuning fuzzy membership functions
- Enable dynamic fuzzy rule generation/pruning
- Dashboard controls for fuzzy rules

## Phase 4: Online/Continual Learning

- Refactor agents for incremental/online updates
- Integrate experience replay for continual learning
- Add meta-learning hooks
- Dashboard toggles for online/continual learning

## Phase 5: Explainability & Visualization

- Visualize fuzzy rules, attention weights, group structures
- Trace agent decisions (rules fired, features attended)
- Generate textual/visual explanations for actions

## Phase 6: Human-in-the-Loop & Feedback

- Enable real-time feedback from dashboard to agents
- Log/analyze human interventions
- Add UI for human-in-the-loop experiments

## Phase 7: Robustness, Experimentation, & Real-World Integration

- Expand adversarial testing and robustness analytics
- Automate large-scale experiments
- Improve real-world connectors (API, sensor, robot)
- Seamless sim/real-world switching

## Phase 8: Advanced Communication & Collaboration

- Implement richer inter-agent communication protocols
- Analyze/visualize emergent comms
- Add cloud dashboard, user auth, collaborative experiments
