# Neuro-Fuzzy Multi-Agent System: Next Roadmap

## 1. Security Audit & Hardening
- [ ] Sanitize and validate all plugin inputs.
- [ ] Enforce subprocess timeouts everywhere plugins are run.
- [ ] Implement OS-level resource limits (memory/CPU) for plugin subprocesses.
- [ ] Ensure all FastAPI endpoints use strict Pydantic validation.
- [ ] Add authentication/authorization to APIs if exposed beyond localhost.
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on public API endpoints.
- [ ] Periodically run security scanners (e.g., Bandit).

## 2. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Batch process experiment results where possible.
- [ ] Use async endpoints and background tasks for long-running operations.
- [ ] Profile code with cProfile/py-spy to find bottlenecks in agent/environment loops.
- [ ] Vectorize agent computations with NumPy where applicable.
- [ ] Explore parallel agent/environment execution (concurrent.futures, Ray).

## 3. Code Quality & Maintainability
- [ ] Add type hints to all functions/methods.
- [ ] Expand/add docstrings, especially for public APIs and plugin interfaces.
- [ ] Adopt Black and isort in addition to Flake8 for formatting.
- [ ] Increase test coverage, especially for plugins, experiment management, and APIs.
- [ ] Add tests for error handling, timeouts, and plugin failures.

## 4. Feature & Usability Enhancements
### Advanced Experiment Reporting
- [ ] Integrate Plotly/Matplotlib for experiment dashboards.
- [ ] Provide summary statistics (mean, std, min/max, etc.).
- [ ] Allow exporting results in CSV/JSON.

### Plugin System
- [ ] Enable hot reloading of plugins.
- [ ] Add CLI command for plugin validation (dependencies, interface compliance).

### Explainability & Human-in-the-Loop
- [ ] Allow registration of custom explanation functions for new agent types.
- [ ] Log all human approvals/denials for auditability.

### Documentation
- [ ] Expand PLUGIN_DEV_GUIDE and DEVELOPER.md with real-world examples and troubleshooting.
- [ ] Auto-generate API reference docs (Sphinx or FastAPI's OpenAPI).

## 5. Additional Ideas
- [ ] Explore distributed execution with Ray/Dask for scaling experiments.
- [ ] Investigate meta-learning and adaptive agent strategies.

**Prioritization and implementation of these roadmap items will significantly improve the security, performance, maintainability, and usability of the neuro-fuzzy multi-agent project.**
